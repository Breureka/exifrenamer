NAME

exifrenamer - move photos based on timestamp metadata

SYNOPSIS
--------

exifrenamer is a small program designed to alleviate the issue of
manually organizing your photos or getting rid of meaningless filenames
(e.g. DSCN0012.JPG).

The program reads the EXIF timestamp from the image file and then moves
it to a destination directory based on that data.

Installation
------------

### Requirements

Python v2.7+

Uninstallation
--------------

Delete the program directory:

    rm -fr ~/.exifrenamer/

Remove the following line from your `.bashrc`:

    export PATH=~/.exifrenamer/bin:"${PATH}"

USAGE
-----

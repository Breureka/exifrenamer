## NAME

exifrenamer - move photos based on timestamp metadata

## SYNOPSIS

exifrenamer is a small program designed to alleviate the issue of manually organizing your photos or getting rid of meaningless filenames (e.g. DSCN0012.JPG).

The program reads the EXIF timestamp from the image file and then moves it to a destination directory based on that data.
